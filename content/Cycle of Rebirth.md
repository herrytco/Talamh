Each sentient organism houses a soul, a collection of information that holds everything that characterizes an individual. It determines personality, intelligence, and every other personal trait. Souls originate from the [[Planes|Spiritual Plane]]. There, [[Vitalis]] can sediment into souls, similar to the formation of [[Livith]] on the [[Planes|Material Plane]]. 

These souls are not stable. They start to slowly disintegrate into energy again. When a soul is needed on the material plane (i.e. a child is born), a random soul is taken from the spiritual plane and is planted into the new life. While the soul resides on the spiritual plane, it is sentient and can roam around the plane, interacting with other souls present. While transported to the material plane, all prior memories of the soul are inhibited. This limit is lifted, once the bearing body dies.
