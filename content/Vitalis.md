The planet is engulfed by channels of energy called Vitalis. The flow of energy is focused in a few high-density currents flowing through and around the planet. These high-density currents branch into smaller ones covering all areas of the world. If the density of energy is high enough, it becomes visible as green lights, streaming in the direction of the current. The location of the currents shifts over time. They tend to move towards regions with low energy density, resulting in a constant shift of energy around the world. 

Vitalis is the base of all life. Each living cell is capable of storing a tiny amount of this energy. This energy servers as an anchor for the soul of living beings. If a person who has been drained of all Vitalis, their soul returns to the global stream and their body dies.

The stream of Vitalis is not bound to only a single [[Planes|Plane]], it is present in all planes of reality in parallel.
