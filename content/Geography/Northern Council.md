[[High Soria]], the northern nation of the continent, is not ruled by a single person. Each house in the country sends a representative to the council. This assembly decides over new developments in the country and serves as the highest legal authority.

This body collectively holds the authority to pass laws, make executive decisions, and govern the countryâ€™s internal and external affairs. The Council operates on a principle of shared power, with decisions being made through deliberation and majority voting. This ensures that no single house or faction can dominate the political landscape, promoting a balanced and equitable governance model.
