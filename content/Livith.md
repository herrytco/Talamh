Ultimately, all existing matter is a form of condensed [[Vitalis]], that was transformed into matter. Regular matter like rocks, water or air is energetically stable. This means that it requires a lot of additional energy, to transform the matter back into Vitalis. Livith is also a solid form of Vitalis, but it is not energetically stable. It lies in between pure energy and stable matter, making it possible to discharge it in a flash of energy, but also letting it settle into pure matter. 

Livith is a crystalline mineral, that has a bright glow to it. If the level of ambient Vitalis in an area rises above a threshold, the crystals start forming. They grow rather slowly and serve as a buffer of energy. While the energy density in the area is high, the crystals are forming. If the global stream shifts, and the area lacks of ambient energy, the crystals start dissipating energy into the environment again.

Similar to a living body, a livith crystal shows an [[Aura]]. Compared to a living one, it is far more regular and even. This aura also has a specific resonance frequency, making it repellant to a living one. This frequency stays to same for each type of livith crystal. 
## Physical Properties
The most common form of livith is a translucent crystal. The material feels warm to the touch and vibrates softly. It is not particularly hard, a motivated strike with a pickaxe or hammer shatters the crystal quite easily. The overall properties of the material do not change when broken down. However, it is harder to tap into the stored energy of livith dust than to use a single crystal. When heated, the livith converts the incoming heat to raw vitalis up to a threshold. It glows brighter with rising energy level. If more vitalis is loaded into the crystal than it can hold, the material releases **all** energy in a single eruption of high destructive power. This level of overcharging can not be achieved with just heating the crystal though, as the conversion of heat to vitalis is quite inefficient.

While a solid is the most common state of livith, it is theoretically possible to create gas or liquid livith as well. This was proven by scientists of the Church of Life, but they did not manage to create a stable sample yet. 
## Common Livith Types
Livith comes in different crystalline structures, giving the material different magical properties. 
### Elemental Livith
The most common type of livith found is a elemental livith. It can manifest their respective element when fueled with Vitalis. While active, the crystal is consumed over time with higher rates of decay for elements like Water and nearly no decay for Light or Fire. 
## Void Livith
This material inverts the incoming Vitalis stream and creates **Anihilis**, an energy opposed to Vitalis. When this new energy comes into contact with Vitalis, both of them react to pure energy, annihilating both Vitalis and Anihilis in the process.
