Runic Spellcraft was developed in the northern nation of [[High Soria]], born from a desire to formalize magical knowledge and distance it from the unpredictability of emotions and individual experiences. High Sorians believed that magic, while deeply personal, could be systematized to create consistent, repeatable results. Through rigorous study and experimentation at the [[High Sorian University]], they pioneered a structured approach to spellcasting that allowed different individuals to achieve the same effects, even if the resulting spells were weaker than those crafted purely through personal Resolve.

This advancement in magical theory became known as **Runic Spellcraft**, a language of commands and logic etched into reality.
## The Foundation of Runic Magic
1.  **Standardization of Magic:**

- Unlike traditional spellcasting, which relies heavily on a mage’s unique perspective and creativity, **Runic Spellcraft** provides a framework that anyone with sufficient training can follow.

- High Soria’s scholars deconstructed magic into its essential components, developing runes to represent universal principles such as fire, movement, and shape. By combining these runes, they could replicate magical effects across casters.

- Runic spells lack the raw power of spells driven by personal Resolve, as they sacrifice individuality for consistency. However, this makes them more stable and accessible to a broader range of practitioners.

## The Role of Runic Spellcrafting in High Soria
Runic Spellcraft reflects High Soria’s cultural identity: logical, disciplined, and forward-thinking. While not as powerful or adaptable as traditional magic, it has revolutionized magical practice by creating a shared framework for spellcasting. The **High Sorian University** continues to refine and expand the runic system, cementing High Soria’s reputation as a hub of magical innovation.

This approach to magic provides a compelling contrast to the raw, emotional magic practiced in other parts of Isholion, enriching the world with philosophical and practical diversity.
## Mechanics
1. Runes as Modular Components
- Each rune functions like a piece of code, contributing to the overall effect. By combining runes, mages can create complex magical sequences with predictable results.

2. Standardized Outcomes
- In traditional magic, two mages casting the same spell might achieve vastly different results due to variations in their Resolve and individual experiences.
- In Runic Spellcraft, the sequence determines the spell’s outcome, ensuring consistency regardless of the caster. For example, a rune sequence for creating light will always generate the same intensity and duration of light, regardless of who casts it.

3. Weakness and Stability
- Runic magic sacrifices raw power for precision. A fireball created through Runic Spellcraft might be smaller and less destructive than one created by a traditional mage (given the same amount of energy used), but it is also less likely to fail or harm the caster.
- This stability makes Runic magic especially valuable in environments where unpredictability is dangerous.
