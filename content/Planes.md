The world itself exists in several planes. These planes exist parallel to the physical world (the material plane) and are vastly different to each other. It is not possible to travel between planes under regular circumstances.

## Material Plane
The material plane is the physical world experienced by people. This is the place, where people live, interact, and experience life.
## Astral Plane
The closest plane to the material plane is the astral plane. It is a sphere of thoughts and ideas, which are tied directly to individuals souls. This plane is comprised of a toned down version of the material plane.  Inanimate objects are pale and without color while individual souls look like bright beacons. 
## Spiritual Plane
Beyond the astral plane lies the spiritual one. If a person dies, their [[Aura]] is released back into the global [[Vitalis]] stream. The soul of the person ends up in the spiritual plane, where it waits to be reborn. During this time, souls are free to roam around this plane and can interact with each other.
