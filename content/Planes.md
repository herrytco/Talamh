The world itself exists in several planes. These planes exist parallel to the physical world (the material plane) and are vastly different to each other. It is not possible to travel between planes under regular circumstances.

## Astral Plane
The closest plane to the material plane is the astral plane. It is a sphere of thoughts and ideas, which are tied directly to individuals souls. This plane is comprised of a toned down version of the material plane.  Inanimate objects are pale and without color while individual souls look like bright beacons.
