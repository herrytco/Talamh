Magic is the art of using the bodies own [[Vitalis]] to change the world around the caster. To begin casting a spell, the mage must draw out their inner energy into their [[Aura]]. This is known as a "flare", because the Aura of the mage gets denser in this process. It becomes erratic and even visible to the naked eye if the concentration of energy is high enough. 

When enough energy is accumulated, the spell itself discharges. Here, a spell can dictate certain mental and physical actions needed for it to work. Some spells require gestures, spoken words or even writing to unleash their potential. Not meeting those requirements usually results in a kickback, as the accumulated energy in the Aura erupts violently around the caster. 

Spellcasting is a very personal process. Spells taught at the **Church of Life** or the **High Sorian University**  are merely the raw prototype, the essence of what a spell is capable of. Learning this spell means to adapt it to the actual caster. 
## Raw Spells
There is a spell, that allows the user to control and manipulate rocks. This is what is called a **raw spell**, a spell without interpretation. A veteran warrior might punch against rocks to form them into projectiles that accelerate towards an enemy but a dancer might incorporate the spell into their dances and manipulate the ground to fit the movements of them. Both spells originate at the same point, but evolved differently for both users. 

This led to a large collection of raw spells that are collected in schools and universities. There, promising candidates learn a variety of standard spells (easy to learn as their concepts are rather basic). If they graduate, these institutions usually provide opportunities to further study the world of magic. 
## Cost
It is not free to perform magic. The caster has to provide the necessary energy for a spell to work. This energy usually comes from their own reservoir of [[Vitalis]] leaving them exhausted afterwards. It is possible for a mage to kill themselves by using up all energy of the body.

It is possible to use other sources of Vitalis to fuel magic. Generally, every Aura in direct contact with the casters one can become provide the fuel for a spell. For this to work, the caster has to attune his aura to the foreign one. After their frequency become the same, both participants can access the combined energy of them. This process requires enormous focus, and is usually only feasible to achieve with meditation and a lot of training. 

A far easier solution is to use a [[Livith]] crystal. It has an easy to attune, constant frequency and even novice mages are able to access their energy fairly easy.  This makes livith the most valuable resource when it comes to spellcasting.
