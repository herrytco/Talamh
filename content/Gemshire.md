Gemshire, situated in the western mountains of [[High Soria]], is a utilitarian village characterized by its specialization in gem cutting and stone masonry. The village is strategically located near a productive mine carved into the mountains, providing a consistent supply of various gems.

The surrounding forest, dense with evergreen trees, contributes to the village's ambiance. Gemshire is recognized for its approach to resource extraction, with miners efficiently extracting precious stones like sapphires and emeralds from the nearby mine.

The village features a central marketplace where gem traders and artisans engage in transactions. Stone cottages, designed for durability rather than ornate aesthetics, dot the landscape. The central square serves as a space for communal activities, festivals, and gatherings, with minimal embellishments.

Gemshire's residents are known for their proficiency in gem-related industries, and the village maintains a focus on the pragmatic aspects of its craft. The balance struck between the rugged mountain environment and the economic pursuits of gemstone extraction and craftsmanship defines the essence of Gemshire.
## Government
Gemshire has a mayor who is in charge of local management. They are the official leader of the local militia and tries to maintain public order. There is a public vote once every five years to elect a new mayor. Their office is located at the central square. It has a publicly accessible ground floor with the mayor's private rooms and office above. The mayor usually personally decides on essential topics, as the city is not really large enough to justify a complex system of ministries.
## Defences
A small militia of around 50 soldiers maintains security and public order. The dedicated garrison is located near the eastern entrance of the town. It has a small public office for people to raise voice problems. The back rooms contain gear and sleeping quarters for the currently working soldiers. 

A few guards patrol the city once every few hours to check if everything is in order. The soldiers also talk to every newcomer to the city to ask about their intentions. Still, the general security level is not that high, as there are no real threats to a town that small apart from the occasional bandits trying to get valuable gems.
## Infrastructure
The town is located near a small river from a spring in the mountains, the citizens' primary source of fresh water. The main entrance to the city is a street, just wide enough to be used with a carriage, which leads to the valley. The average travel time to the next greater village is around one hour on horseback. Gemshire is located in a forest clearing. Some buildings are already built on the outskirts of the forest.
## Natural Resources
The primary mine of Gemshire is about 30 minutes of walking away from the town.  On the outside, miners built a small wooden cottage containing supplies and tools. It has room for two people to sit comfortably as well as a cart to be used for transporting raw gems back to the city.
